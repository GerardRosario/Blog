# Blog / Content Management System
Requirements By: Random Client


I’m a small company owner that wants to blog to the world to help generate publicity. My needs are small:

- Give me a way to display my blog posts to everyone who comes to my site. 
- Give me a way to enter my blog posts so that only I can add them.

- Now, I don’t want to have to write HTML in my blog posts. Could you give me a way to write my posts in an editor like Word? I hear there’s something called TinyMCE. Can you hook me up? 

- What would be nice… I need to categorize my blog posts. And since this is a #hashtag #crazy #world, I probably should have some way to tag my posts with multiple tags as well. 

- I need a way to add static pages. Again, I want the world to view the pages, but only I can write these pages. Remember, I don’t like writing straight HTML at the end of the day, so if you can hook me up with an editor that lets me write rich text and post images, that would be awesome.

- I am hiring someone to handle my marketing and blog posts. So, I need the ability to let them post as well. But I want to be able to approve their posts when they’re made.
